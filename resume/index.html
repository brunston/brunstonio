<p>Begun June 2015: I am currently an intern with Dr. Geoff Mathews at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am writing <a href="http://st.bpbp.xyz/">stellarPYL</a>, which is stellar spectra reduction and analysis command-line software written in Python 3, numpy, Pillow, and matplotlib. The software aims to provide a one-click workflow for analyzing uncompressed TIFF stellar spectra images obtained from a DSLR through a diffraction grating. Data being used comes from the setup paid for by the SPS Thomas Penrose Bennettt Prize named below. The internship is conducted in conjunction with the St. Paul’s School Engineering Honors program. A paper is currently being written.</p>

<p>I am the recipient of the 2014 St. Paul’s School Thomas Penrose Bennett Prize, which is a grant awarded to students who apply to do a science project of their choice. I have collected data from a spectrometer I installed at the Hawley Observatory on campus, which is now part of the stellarPYL spectroscopy package.</p>

<p>From June to the beginning of August 2014 I was a Teaching Assistant at a few Nueva Summer intensives, which are run by The Nueva School. I primarily taught writing intensives for middle school students. I created, implemented, and revised poetry curriculum within one of these intensives. I also helped students develop compelling narratives, multi-dimensional characters and colorful worlds. The poetry curriculum was also used in programs by <a href="http://www.blue4beban.org/">The Leyla Beban Young Authors Foundation.</a></p>

<p>From August through October 2013 I worked part-time as a Content Assistant at Khan Academy, checking their videos for errors and adding clarifications.</p>

<p>In August 2013 I was an IT intern at The Nueva School, working on the new Nueva High School and setting up infrastructure at their temporary campus.</p>

<p>From June to August 2013 I was an intern at Khan Academy Discovery Lab, doing some videography, photography, and improving their various  robotics education platforms to better teach inspired children the basics of robotics and computer science. I worked with that summer’s Director of Marketing to expand their online presence through numerous photos and high-quality video sequences detailing the many projects that the students at Discovery Lab work on during their week-long experience. I was Discovery Lab’s first intern, and (at the time) Khan Academy’s youngest intern.</p>
