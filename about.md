###Bio

I am a seventeen-year-old high school senior at St. Paul’s School in Concord, NH. Home is in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I hold passions in the sciences—particularly in astronomy and physics, but also in the applied realms of robotics and computer science. I code in Python, mostly scientific data reduction or analysis scripting, but I have also conceived and co-implemented a genetic algorithm for blackjack.

For fun, I write, photograph, and play music. I have played piano at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall and am the president of the St. Paul’s School Guild of Carillonneurs.
