{"name":"Brunston Poon","tagline":"About me and what I do.","body":"###Bio\r\n\r\nI am a seventeen-year-old high school senior at St. Paul’s School in Concord, NH. Home is in the San Francisco Bay Area.\r\n\r\nI hold passions in the sciences—particularly in astronomy and physics, but also in the applied realms of robotics and computer science. I code in Python, mostly scientific data reduction or analysis scripting, but I have also conceived and co-implemented a genetic algorithm for blackjack.\r\n\r\nFor fun, I write, photograph, and play music. I have played piano at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall and am the president of the St. Paul’s School Guild of Carillonneurs.\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\n\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/brupoon/)\r\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunston)\r\n* [Hubski](https://hubski.com/user?id=demure)\r\n* [Email](mailto:brupoon@outlook.comREMOVETHESECAPS)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
