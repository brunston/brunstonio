Bio
===

Hi! I'm Brunston Poon, an EECS student in the UC Berkeley College of Engineering, Class of 2020. I also am an alumnus of St. Paul's School, Form of 2016.

My research and academic interests are broad, though of late I focus on the intersection of domain science with computer science, and integrated hardware/software development. At present, I am a research assistant with the Center for Time Domain Informatics at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, focusing on the Cesium-ML project.

In the fall of 2016 I was an undergraduate research apprentice at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory; I was formerly an intern at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company and an intern with Dr. Geoff Mathews of the University of Hawaii doing low-cost stellar spectroscopy development.

Regarding my non-STEM interests, I have played the piano for over a decade. I love to write (particularly poetry). I'm also a good whistler and a voracious reader. Below, you will find a list of projects I find worth highlighting.
