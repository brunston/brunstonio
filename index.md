Bio
===

Hi! I'm Brunston Poon. My interests are broad; I am currently an intern with Dr. Geoff Mathews of the University of Hawaii doing low-cost stellar spectroscopy development, I have played the piano for over a decade (and made it to Carnegie Hall), and I love to write (particularly poetry). I'm also a fairly good whistler and a voracious reader. Below, you will find a list of projects I find worth highlighting.
