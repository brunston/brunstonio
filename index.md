Recent Activity
===============

I am working on jumpstarting my company, [Fanalytical Solutions](http://fanalyticalsolutions.com). I've also been putting the final touches on [stellarPYL](http://brunston.io/stellarpyl).

Extended Bio
============

My research and academic interests are broad, though of late I focus on the intersection of domain science with computer science, and integrated hardware/software development. At present, I work on a number of projects.

I am currently an electrical engineering intern at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company Advanced Technology Center. There, I work on RF related software and hardware projects, as well as VR prototyping.

[Fanalytical Solutions](http://fanalytical.solutions/) is a company I co-founded with my friend [Brian O'Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdosullivan/). FS provides data analytics and forecasting services to sports franchises to help them boost revenue, attendance, and to streamline their logistics and planning processes.

I am also a research assistant with the Center for Time Domain Informatics at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, focusing on the Cesium-ML project.

In the fall of 2016 I was an undergraduate research apprentice at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory; I was formerly an intern at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company and an intern with Dr. Geoff Mathews of the University of Hawaii doing low-cost stellar spectroscopy development.

Regarding my non-STEM interests: I have played the piano for over a decade. I love to write (particularly poetry). I'm also a good whistler and a voracious reader. Below, you will find a list of projects I find worth highlighting.
