<h1 id="recent-activity">Recent Activity</h1>

<p>Continuing to work on <a href="http://fanalyticalsolutions.com">Fanalytical Solutions</a>. Just finished a Summer 2018 cybersecurity internship at Boeing. Took a semester off at Berkeley to intern at SpaceX. I’m also trying to <a href="http://albatrossian.xyz/photos/thirtyinthirty/">get used to my new-to-me Fuji X100s</a>.</p>

<h1 id="extended-bio">Extended Bio</h1>

<p>My research and academic interests are broad, though of late I focus on the intersection of domain science with computer science, and integrated hardware/software development. At present, I work on a number of projects.</p>

<p>I was a cybersecurity intern from May to August 2018 in the BCA Cybersecurity Product Development group at Boeing.</p>

<p>I spent January to May 2018 as an Avionics Intern at SpaceX, in the Avionics Test Engineering group. I worked on test software infrastructure, designing test hardware PCBs, and designing complete test systems for both Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon.</p>

<p>From June to August 2017 I was an electrical engineering intern at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company Advanced Technology Center. There, I worked on RF related software and hardware projects, as well as VR prototyping.</p>

<p><a href="http://fanalytical.solutions/">Fanalytical Solutions</a> is a company I co-founded with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdosullivan/">Brian O’Sullivan</a>. FS provides data analytics and forecasting services to sports franchises to help them boost revenue, attendance, and to streamline their logistics and planning processes.</p>

<p>I spent Spring 2017 as a research assistant with the Center for Time Domain Informatics at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, focusing on the Cesium-ML project.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2016 I was an undergraduate research apprentice at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory; I was formerly an intern at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company and an intern with Dr. Geoff Mathews of the University of Hawaii doing low-cost stellar spectroscopy development.</p>

<p>Regarding my non-STEM interests: I have played the piano for over a decade. I love to write (particularly poetry). I’m also a good whistler and a voracious reader. Below, you will find a list of projects I find worth highlighting.</p>
